// Problem 1
//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
//Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
Int sum = 0
for (Int N = 1 to 1000 | N % 3 == 0 or N % 5 == 0) {
    sum = sum + N
}
print(sum) //233168
